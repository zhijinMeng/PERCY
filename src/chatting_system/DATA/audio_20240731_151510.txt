Hello, how are you? How's your project? Yeah, it's going good, but I need to train some. Oh, now? It will be much better. We are fighting with one desktop. Ah, I see, I see. Yeah, you can use the desktop. But I think, if I want to train that desktop, I don't want any kind of heavy work to be going on. You don't want what? Very complicated work should be going on in your work, because last time the Gazebo stopped. Too many browsers were opened, and we are getting wrong readings. Well, I think, although we have multiple terminal running, it shouldn't stop your Gazebo. It's not crashed, Gazebo crashed. Crashed? Are you sure it's because we opened too many terminals? Too many browsers were opened in Mozilla Firefox. Really? Too many browsers, I don't know. Oh, maybe. I was getting wrong readings.
